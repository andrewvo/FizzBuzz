# Fizz Buzz

The rules of _Fizz Buzz_ are really straightforward:

* When a number is divisible by three (3) `Fizz` is output
* When a number is divisible by five (5) `Buzz` is output
* When a number is divisible by three (3) _and_  five (5) then `FizzBuzz` is output

Otherwise the number itself is output.

E.g. `1`, `2`, `Fizz`, `4`, `Buzz`...

## Tasks

1. Create a console application that prints out the numbers `1` to `100`, applying the rules of _Fizz Buzz_
2. Extend your console application to accept new low and high boundary numbers, if the numbers are not provided the application should default to using `1` for the low boundary and `100` for the high boundary

## Unit tests

A [Unit test project](FizzBuzz.Tests) with a [single test](FizzBuzz.Tests/GetOutputTests.cs) has been provided. If possible provide tests that prove the correctness of your code.

## What we're looking for

1. Code that can be compiled and run
2. Code that outputs the correct values
3. This is your chance to shine and show us what you can do. Show us how you arrived at your completed solution, so do lots of commits, even if you decide that a step is incorrect
